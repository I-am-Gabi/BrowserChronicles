        <description>After an exhausting encounter with a bugbear, four travelling heroes are grateful
            to find a small town nestled in the unfamiliar hills. Their relief quickly turns
            to suspicion, however, when they find the town of Angurkslariun uninhabited—at least by
            the living.

            <b>So you chose to go to the city of Angurkslariun.</b>
            The town is little more than ten or twelve buildings scattered on either side of the weedy road.
            You can see a graveyard, then an abandoned camp, then finally a cave. BUT, WAIT!
            What is that? Wraiths, possessed animals and beasts they begin to emerge from the dark places of cite.
            Then you progress further into the cave, however, you can see more human enemies... Necromancers come in
            your direction.
